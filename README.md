<h1>Hello GitHub people!</h1>

Just a quick introduction .ReadMe, nothing technicial (the good stuff) yet .

My name is Chris! I'm an aspiring full-stack developer that is looking to learn/grow from others and through coding. Some of the code I have on here might not be the best thing out there and make you pull your hair out, but, <strong><i>PLEASE</i></strong>, if you have any tips or better methods to completing certain parts of my code, please point them out and allow me to learn from you!

Looking forward to learning from you all!
